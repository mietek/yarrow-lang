This directory contains all documentation on Yarrow. It is all in
html-format, so it is most easily read using a browser.

A description of the files: 
 - index.html  The home-page for Yarrow. Contains references to the rest.
 - insta.html  The main-page for installation.
 - inBin.html  Installing and running the binaries.
 - inHas.html  Installing and running Yarrow under Haskell
 - liter.html  References to literature about Yarrow. The reports themselves
               are NOT supplied; they can be found on-line.
 - relea.html  Release notes
 - userg.html  The user guide
 - sessions    Some documentation on the examples in the main directory
               "sessions".
