<H2><CENTER>New in Yarrow v1.20 (since v1.00)</CENTER></H2>

<H1>Main changes</H1>
<UL>
<LI>
Yarrow now supports forward reasoning, with the 'Forward' tactic.
<!--
  - The 'Forward' tactic
    9-10-'97
  - The Forward, Apply, OrE, AndE, NotE, ExistsE, Rewrite and Lewrite tactics
    have been extended.
    Especially the 'Forward' tactic benefits from this extension.
    [EXAMPLE]
    29-1-'98
-->
<LI>
Yarrow now supports records and subtyping.
<!--
  - Two extensions of DPTSs are implemented: records and subtyping.
    23-6-'98
-->
</UL>

<H1>Other significant changes</H1>
<UL>
<LI>
It is possible to declare a variable as 'Binder', which makes terms better
readable.
<LI>
 All commands and tactics have become case-insensitive, e.g. you can type
'Intros' or 'InTrOs' instead of 'Intros'.
<!-- 13-10-'97 -->
<LI> The 'Undo' command is now local, i.e. it undoes the last step in the
    current goal instead of the absolute last step. As a consequence,
    no tactics can be undone if the goal is proved.
    The 'History' command is adapted accordingly, it also prints the tactics
    in a more structured way.
<!-- 3-11-'97 -->
<LI>
   It is now possible to suppress printing of selected elements of the local
    context, with the tactic 'Hide'. The tactic 'Unhide' makes the
    suppression undone.
<!--    9-8-'98-->
<LI>The tactics 'ExistsE', 'ExistsI', 'Refl', 'Rewrite' and 'Lewrite' have been
    made more
    flexible: The existential quantification and the equality predicate
    can be arbitrarily polymorphic (including not polymorphic at all)
<!--    9-8-'98-->
<LI> The tactics Rewrite and Lewrite can also be used in hypotheses.
    <!-- 23-11-'98 -->
</UL>

<H1>Minor changes</H1>
<UL>
<LI>
    The special tactics 'AndEL' and 'AndER' replace the old 'AndE' tactic.
    This is still available; it is a combination of 'AndEL' and 'AndER'.
    <!-- 11-10-'97 -->
<LI> The 'Focus' command is no longer a tactic.
    <!-- 3-11-'97 -->
<LI> The tactical 'Then' has been made more flexible.
    <!-- 23-6-'98 -->
<LI> A new tactical 'Else'.
    <!-- 23-6-'98 -->
<LI> Also if a line ends with ':=', the command may be completed on the next 
    line.
    <!-- 20-5-'99 -->
</UL>

<H1>Bug fixes</H1>
<UL>
<LI> 'Prove @x1,x2:Nat. P x1 x2' and then 'Intros' lead to variables 'x' and
    'x1' in the context instead of 'x1' and 'x2'.
<!--    21-10-'97-->
<LI> During the summary of the used tactics, terms were sometimes printed
    in an awkward way, e.g. 'convert (=) x y'.
<!--    21-10-'97-->
<LI> The matching routine sometimes gave an internal error. This resulted
    sometimes in internal errors when using 'Apply' or rewriting tactics.
<!--    31-7-'98-->
<LI> The tactic 'Pattern' sometimes resulted in an ill-typed goal. Now any
    attempt to do so results in an error.
<!--    20-5-'99-->
</UL>
