<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>How to try these Yarrow sessions</H2>
It is most convenient to use Yarrow in combination with a windows system.
I suggest you have two windows to try these example sessions in Yarrow:
<UL>
<LI>One containing a shell in which you start up yarrow with the command<BR>
    <CODE>yarrow</CODE>
<LI>One containing the commands that we will give to Yarrow.
    These commands are always contained in files in a subdirectory of
    <CODE>sessions</CODE>. This file is best
    displayed with a text editor, so you can drag commands to the shell
    windows and you don't have to type them yourself.
</UL>

For example, load the file <CODE>sessions/example/exam.ys</CODE> in the
text editor and drag the first line to Yarrow. You will see
<PRE>
> prove silly : @P:*.P->P
--------------------------------------------------
@P:*. P->P

$ 
</PRE>
Dragging the next line to Yarrow will result in
<PRE>
$ intros then assumption
Goal proved!

$ 
</PRE>
And the last line will give
<PRE>
$ exit
prove silly : @P:*. P->P
intros then assumption
exit

silly := .. : @P:*. P->P
> 
</PRE>

<P>
Sometimes you will drag multiple lines to Yarrow which may result in the
input and output not to be interleaved correctly. Blame your windows
system for this.

When you start working on your own proofs in Yarrow, you typically work 
in the same way, with one window containing Yarrow and one containing a
text editor with the session you are working on. Then the text is dragged
in the other direction, from the Yarrow window to the editor window.
This works easy because after the end of a proof, Yarrow gives a summary of
all the commands that were used.
