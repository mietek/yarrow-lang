<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Example sessions in Yarrow</H2>
<UL>
<P>     
Yarrow is distributed with a number of example sessions, given below.
We advise to read first how to 
<A HREF="first.html">try these examples in the most convenient way</A>.

<P>The example sessions are:
<LI>The directory <CODE>sessions/tutorial</CODE> contains a small
    tutorial session. The tutorial itself is available as
    <A HREF="tutor.ps"><CODE>doc/sessions/tutor.ps</CODE></A>.
    It is intended for people who are familiar with Pure Type
Systems, but not necessarily with proof-assistants.
<LI>The directory <CODE>sessions/cube</CODE> contains the definitions of
    all systems of the lambda cube.
<LI>The directory <CODE>sessions/Uminus</CODE> contains the definition of
    the PTS lambda-U-minus, and shows its inconsistency.
<LI>The directory <CODE>sessions/logic</CODE> defines a PTS corresponding
    with a logic for reasoning about programs, and defines the usual
    logical connectives and the equality.
<LI>The directory <CODE>sessions/datatyp</CODE> contains the definitions of
    the datatype <CODE>bool</CODE>, <CODE>list</CODE> and <CODE>nat</CODE>,
    using the impredicative encoding. (Yarrow has no inductive datatypes).
<LI>The directory <CODE>sessions/demos</CODE> contains demonstrations of
    the infix notation and the rewrite tactic.
<LI>The directory <CODE>sessions/thesis</CODE>
    contains the formal theory developed in my thesis.
