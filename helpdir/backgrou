Yarrow started off as an implementation of a typing algorithm for PTSs.
      Over the time it evolved into a simple proof-assistant.
      Its main features are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> A particular pure type system (with subtyping) can be chosen at run-time.
<LI> There are general tactics for proving propositions.
<LI> Tactics for forward reasoning.
<LI> Special rewriting tactics for the Leibniz-equality, and tactics for 
     propositional and predicate logic.
<LI> An easy-to-use system for infix notation, implicit arguments and binders.
<LI> It is portable, because it runs on any platform on which 
     Haskell runs. This includes <!--PC's and--> most Unix systems.
<LI> It has a built-in help system.
<!-- <LI> The implementation is well documented. There is extensive
     documentation on how to add your own tactics.-->
</UL>

<P>
This program has some disadvantages compared to other proof-assistants:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> No automatic proof-search tactics.
<LI> No inductive types, since they do not belong to PTSs.
<LI> No mouse-control, but some effort has been spent to make
     the keyboard-interface user-friendly.
</UL>

<P>
This program was developed by Jan Zwanenburg. 
Questions and remarks will be gratefully received and answered.
