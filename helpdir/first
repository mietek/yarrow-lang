<DL>
 <DT>Syntax:
 <DD><CODE>First</CODE> <VAR>term</VAR>
 <DT>Effect:
 <DD> Prove the goal by using the cut rule for <VAR>term</VAR>.
      That is, first prove <VAR>term</VAR>, and prove the current
      goal later with assumption <VAR>term</VAR>.<BR>
      The only difference with <CODE>Cut</CODE> is the order of the
      generated subgoals. Indeed, it is the same as <CODE>Cut</CODE>
      followed by <CODE>Focus 2</CODE>.
 <DT>See also:
 <DD><A HREF="#Cut"><CODE>Cut</CODE></A>,
     <A HREF="#Focus"><CODE>Focus</CODE></A>
