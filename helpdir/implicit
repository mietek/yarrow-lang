 <DT>Syntax:
 <DD><CODE>Implicit</CODE> <VAR>num</VAR> <VAR>var</VAR>
 <DT>Effect:
 <DD><P>
     Often a number of type-arguments are superfluous, 
     in the sense that they can be derived from the 
     context. Yarrow has a simple way of suppressing most 
     useless arguments. Arguments to a variable can be 
     suppressed in Yarrow, if they can be derived by 
     inspecting following arguments. In most cases, this 
     is good enough. Internally, always all parameters are 
     represented.
     </P>
     <P>
     This command is only allowed if <VAR>var</VAR> has been 
     defined. It expresses that you want to suppress the 
     first <VAR>num</VAR> arguments of <VAR>var</VAR>.
     After this command, the first <VAR>num</VAR> arguments may be 
     all left out, but this is not compulsory; otherwise 
     all of them must be given. In order to be able 
     to decide whether or not some arguments are implicit, 
     the restriction is made that the first argument of <VAR>var</VAR>
     has an other sort than the <VAR>num</VAR>+1th argument.
     </P>
     <P>
     If option i is turned off, implicit arguments are no 
     longer admitted, and all arguments are printed. 
     Turning this option on again will re-allow implicit 
     arguments in exactly the same way as before.
     </P>
 <DT>Examples:
 <DD>Assume the following declarations have been made:<BR>
     <CODE>id : @A:*.A-&gt;A<BR>
           comp : @A,B,C:*. (B-&gt;C) -&gt; (A-&gt;B) -&gt; (A-&gt;C)<BR>
           (=) : @A:*. A-&gt;A-&gt;Prop<BR>
     </CODE>      Then the following commands define these 
                  variables to have the usual number of 
                  implicit arguments:<BR>
     <CODE>Implicit 1 id<BR>
           Implicit 3 comp<BR>
           Implicit 1 (=)</CODE><BR>
     And so the following expressions are admitted:<BR>
     <CODE>id O</CODE> (means <CODE>id Nat O</CODE>)<BR>
     <CODE>comp not even</CODE>  
                       (means <CODE>comp Nat Bool Bool not even</CODE>)<BR>
     <CODE>O=O</CODE> (means <CODE>(=) Nat O O</CODE>)
 <DT>Shortcomings:
 <DD>Sometimes arguments are not printed while they cannot be inferred.
