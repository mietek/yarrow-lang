Yarrow is an implementation of Pure Type Systems
(see <A HREF="#Bar92">[Bar92]</A>) with several extensions.
In Yarrow you can experiment with various pure type systems, 
with emphasis on using a type system as a logic.  
A basic knowledge on type systems and the Curry-Howard-de Bruijn 
isomorphism is required. Experience with proof-assistants 
is useful for proving theorems.

There are three extensions of PTSs implemented in Yarrow.
First, we have definitions. Definitions are 
indispensable for any practical use of PTSs.
Pure Type Systems with definitions (DPTs) are defined in
<A HREF="#SP93">[SP93]</A>; 
the most important property of these systems is that apart from 
GLOBAL definitions definitions in the context, also LOCAL
definitions within terms are admitted.
<BR>
Second, we have subtyping. Subtyping makes the type system more flexible.
In particular, it can be used with records to allow formalization of 
Object-Oriented Programming to a certain degree.
Pure Type Systems with Subtyping are defined in
<A HREF="#Zwa99">[Zwa99]</A>.
<BR>
Third, we have records. Records are useful for defining programs in a PTS,
in particular Object-Oriented programs.

Yarrow is equipped with a fairly extensive help system, that can 
give a short list of commonly used commands or give more 
detailed information on one command. Type 'help help' to see 
how to use the help system. To see the syntax we use, type  
'help syntax'.

Yarrow has two modes. It starts in the MAIN-mode, where you can 
get the type of a term, reduce terms and extend the context. 
From the main-mode you can get to the PROVE-mode by the 'prove'-
command. In the prove-mode a term for a certain type is 
interactively constructed. When this is done, the program 
returns to the main-mode.
When in the prove-mode, there is an important distinction 
between COMMANDS and TACTICS. A tactic constructs a part of 
a proof-term, can be composed with other tactics, and be undone. 
A command has no effect on the proof-term.
For more information on tactics, type 'help tactics'.

<P>
For the background of Yarrow, type 'help background'. There is   
also described how you can contact the author in case of 
questions or remarks.

Happy typing!
