 <DT>Effect:
 <DD>The conclusion of the type of <VAR>term</VAR> should be a disjunction.
     This tactic
     generates (at least) two new goals.
     The two new goals have the same conclusion as
     the old goal, but the local context of the first goal is augmented by
     the disjunct on the left hand side, and likewise for the second goal
     and the disjunct on the right hand side.   
     If <VAR>term</VAR> is a local variable, this variable is hidden.<BR>                    
     The second variant is a combination of 'Forward' and 'OrE 1'.<BR>
     This tactic needs an elimation lemma for disjunction of the
     following form:<BR>
     <CODE>@P,Q:s1. @R:s2. or P Q -> (P->R) -> (Q->R) -> R</CODE>
 <DT>Shortcomings:
 <DD>It is not possible to give the name of the new hypotheses.
