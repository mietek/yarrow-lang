<DL>
 <DT>Syntax:
 <DD><CODE>Prove</CODE> <VAR>var</VAR> <CODE>: </CODE> <VAR>term</VAR>
 <DT>Effect:
 <DD> Enter the prove-mode to find an inhabitant of
      <VAR>term</VAR>, which will be assigned to <VAR>var</VAR>.
      When the prove-mode is left, the inhabitant will be
      type-checked so that correctness of the proof depends
      only on the type-checking algorithm. A summary of all
      used tactics is displayed, for the convenience of the user.<BR>
      <VAR>term</VAR> must be typable with a sort.
 <DT>Note:
 <DD>This command is also available in prove-mode. In other words, you
     can have multiple proof-tasks at one time. For switching between
     them, use <CODE>Task</CODE>.
