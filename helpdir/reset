 <DT>Syntax:

 <DT>Effect:
 <DD>Removes all entries in the context, starting from <VAR>var</VAR>.<BR>
               Implicit declarations for these variables are also reset,
               but infix declarations are not.<BR>
     Variables occurring in loaded modules cannot be removed. If the
     context starting with this variable has to be deleted anyway, the
     modules should be cleared first.
