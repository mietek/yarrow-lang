<DL>
 <DT>Syntax:
 <DD>
   <CODE>Save</CODE> "<VAR>filename</VAR>"
 <DT>Effect:
 <DD>Saves the piece of the context not belonging to existing modules in
     module <VAR>filename</VAR><CODE>.yc</CODE>. The type system used,
     the import list and infix and implicit declarations are also stored.
     The import list for this module is the list of all modules currently
     loaded.<BR>
     However, if <VAR>filename</VAR> is the most recent module, it is
     updated. That means that the piece of the context added since this 
     module was loaded is added to the module.<BR>
     If <VAR>filename</VAR> is another loaded module, it can't be updated.
 <DT>Example:
 <DD><CODE>Save "integer"</CODE>
 <DT>See also:                          
 <DD><A HREF="#Load"><CODE>Load</CODE></A>,
