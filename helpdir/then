 <DT>Effect:
 <DD><P> The tactical first performs <VAR>tactic</VAR> and then
      <VAR>tactic1</VAR> on the first of the generated subgoals,
      <VAR>tactic2</VAR> on the second of the generated subgoals,
      etc. If there are more new subgoals than tactics, the last tactic
      in the list is applied to the rest of the subgoals.
      If there are fewer new subgoals than tactics, the rest of the tactics
      is ignored.
      If any application
      of a tactic fails, the combination fails as a whole,
      meaning it has no effect.</P>
     <P>The second variant is just an instance of the first variant, where
         <VAR>n</VAR> equals one, and the parentheses have been left out.
        So <VAR>tactic1</VAR> is performed on all generated subgoals.
     </P>
