  <LI><CODE>Undo</CODE>
  <LI><CODE>Undo</CODE> <VAR>num</VAR>

 <DT>Effect:
 <DD>Makes the last tactic of the current goal undone (so this a local undo).
     The second variant makes
               the last <VAR>num</VAR> tactics undone. In case the number of
               tactics you want to undo is unknown, this can be
               looked up with the <CODE>History</CODE> command.<BR>
               Note that this command doesn't make the effect of
               COMMANDS (e.g. <CODE>Infix</CODE> or <CODE>Option</CODE>) undone.
