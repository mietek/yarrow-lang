This directory contains directories with input files for Yarrow.
There are two sort of files:
 - script files. These have the extension '.ys' . They are entered in Yarrow
   with the command 'Read', and are treated just as if you entered the
   contents by keyboard. These files should be readable by humans.
 - code files. These have the extension '.yc' . They are loaded in Yarrow
   with the command 'Load', and are representations of
   a piece of context in some internal form. These files are NOT intended for
   humans.
                           
There are eight directories containing input files:
 - example  contains one silly example
 - tutorial contains the script file for the tutorial. The text for the
            tutorial is in ../doc/sessions/tutor.ps.
 - cube     contains the definitions of the 8 PTSs from the lambda cube.
 - Uminus   contains the definition of the PTS lambda-U-minus and
            the proof it is inconsistent.
 - logic    contains files setting up a logic for reasoning about programs
            or sets.
 - datatyp  contains the definitions of some datatypes with some properties,
            based on the logic in directory 'logic'.
 - demos    contains a few demonstrations of features of Yarrow, also based
            on some definitions from directory 'logic'.
 - thesis   contains the formal theory developed in my thesis.

Furthermore we have the files
 - naming   This file gives some conventions concerning the names of lemmas.
 - scripts  This file gives some conventions concerning script files.
