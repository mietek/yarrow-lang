The files in this directory define datatypes or sets using the standard
(impredicative) encoding.
Of course most of the modules are devoted to establishing some
properties about these types.

Description of the files:
 - bool     defines the booleans
 - nat      defines the natural numbers 
 - plus     defines addition on natural numbers
 - list     defines the lists
