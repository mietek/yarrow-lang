The files in this directory set up a logic for reasoning about programs.
We use the following sorts:
  *s  (for Set) is the type of all datatypes or sets
  *p  (for Prop) is the type of all propositions

Short description of the files:
 - lambdaL  defines the type system we use
 - prop     defines the proposition connectives False, True, /\ and \/,
            and proves some of their properties.
 - pred     defines the existential quantification.
 - is       defines the Leibniz-equality and some of its properties.
 - classic  adds an axiom for classical logic and establishes some
            consequences.
 - functio  defines the identity function and functional composition and
            derives some of their properties.
So there are no specific datatypes defined here; for this go to directory
perDat.
