Guidelines for script files

All script files in the subdirectories are set up as follows:
- Additions to the search path (optional).
- Declaration of the PTS being used.
  Either directly or by loading a script-file defining the system.
- A list of modules to be loaded.
- The body of the script, containing definitions, axioms and proofs.

Because of this set-up, script files can easily be (re-)compiled to code
files by performing the following actions:
- Go to the directory containing the script file
- Start Yarrow
- Enter 
    read "name"
- The script should be executed succesfully. Then enter 
    save "name"
  This creates a code file.
In later sessions, it is sufficient to type
  load "name"
to quickly load the corresponding piece of theory.
